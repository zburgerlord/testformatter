# testformatter
formats txt or docx for respondus import 

## current limitations
1. only multiple choice and T/F supported
2. images and tables break the program (output blank file b/c there is no error handling)

## guide to stuff in here
1. build folder contains most recent version, test files, and instructions/version history
2. zip files contain executable, test files (one txt and one docx), and instructions/version history
3. previous versions and source in respective folders
