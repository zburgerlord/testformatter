# testformatter
python ditty that formats txt or docx for respondus import 

## current limitations
1. only multiple choice and T/F question types supported
2. images and tables break the program (outputs blank file b/c there is no error handling)

## guide to stuff in here
1. build folder contains most recent version, test files, and instructions/version history
2. zip files contain executable, test files (one txt and one docx), and instructions/version history (i.e. everything in the build folder)
3. previous versions and source in respective folders
