v2.0
The test formatter now supports docx files!  It doesn't work for pre-2007 Word documents.  The old format (txt only) is still available as an option for processing files.  Also added was a done message at the end as a signal for users.  The icon was changed to keep things from being confusing with previous versions.

Instructions:
1. Choose the type of test you would like to format (TXT or DOCX).
2. Choose the file to open.
3. Name your save file. This still saves as txt only.
4. That's it!

v1.0
Here is the test formatter that should strip out the answers (and other extraneous information) and place the answers in a numbered list at the end of the document.  One thing for this version:

1.	Tests have to be in .txt format to be opened (Word files won’t work)
